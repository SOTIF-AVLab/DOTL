# Digitalization of regulations
## Introduction
Safety is the primary issue facing the commercialization of autonomous vehicles,traffic laws are a powerful means of ensuring vehicle safety and important evidence for the traceability of accidents. However, the ambiguity of language laws for human drivers and the complexity of dynamic and static multi-constraint coupling scenarios bring severe challenges to compliance research and are the key problems hindering the safe development of autonomous driving. This research intends to start with the research on the systematic digitalization of traffic laws, explore the influence filed of vehicle behaviors, select the reasonable compliance judgment thresholds, and then research the real-time compliance monitoring methods.
